4. **Title:** Making Traffic Management Smart and Secure using Federated Learning

5. **Objectives of the Project:**
   - Develop a federated learning architecture for distributed traffic data processing and model training while ensuring data privacy.
   - Implement a local data processing pipeline for preprocessing and feature extraction from traffic sensor data.
   - Design and train a local machine learning model to predict optimal traffic light durations based on real-time traffic conditions such as traffic congestion and emergency vehicle presence.
   - Create a secure communication protocol for model update sharing between edge devices and the central server.
   - Develop an aggregation algorithm for efficiently combining model updates from multiple sources by researching and modifying available federated learning algorithms.
   - Implement a system for dynamic traffic light control and emergency vehicle routing based on the federated model predictions.

6. **Work Done So Far:**
   - Conducted a comprehensive literature review of existing traffic management systems, identifying key challenges and limitations in current approaches.
   - Researched and evaluated various federated learning architectures to design the most suitable architecture for our traffic management model.
   - Identified and acquired appropriate datasets for training and testing our model, ensuring diverse traffic scenarios and conditions are represented.
   - Initiated preprocessing of the selected dataset, including:
     - **Frame Extraction**: Extracted frames from the uploaded video and saved each frame as an image file.
     - **Compression**: Compressed the saved frame images into a ZIP file for efficient storage and access.
     - **Object Detection**: Loaded the YOLOv8 model and used it to detect and count objects in each frame for further analysis.
